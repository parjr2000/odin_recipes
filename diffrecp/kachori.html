            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Grind the lentils coarsely.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When they begin to splutter, add the lentils and the rest of the ingredients, which make up the
                        filling.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Saute over low heat till the mixture is well fried. It will stop sticking to the pan when done.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Take mixture off heat and leave to cool.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Mix in the flour and salt.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add the ghee to the flour.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Make it into a crumbly mixture with the tips of your fingers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add enough water, to make it into a stiffish dough (it should not yield easily when a finger is
                        pressed into it). Cover and leave to rest for at least 15-20 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Make marble-sized balls of the lentil mixture (called pithee) wetting your hands as and when
                        necessary to prevent the mixture from sticking to them. Cover with a cloth till ready to fill.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Make about 20 smooth balls from the dough. Roll them out till 1/4 " thick (about 5 cms/ 2 in
                        diameter).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Take one piece of rolled dough and pinch the edge all around, leaving the center thicker.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Dampen the pressed edges, place a ball of filling in the center and bring wet edges together,
                        covering the filling completely. Press together to seal.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Place this piece in your palm and with the heal of the other palm, press gently in the center.
                        Flatten a bit with palm first then roll it lightly in a round.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The kachauris are now ready to be fried. Heat the oil in a kadahi.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When a piece of dough dropped in oil comes up at once, put in as many kachauris that can fit in;
                        turn over immediately and lower heat to medium.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Fry them till they all turn an even golden in color; reducing the heat from medium to low.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Takes about 10 minutes for one side and 7-8 minutes on the other. Remove from oil, drain and
                        place on absorbent paper. Serve hot.</p>
