    <p>Samosa, does it need any introduction? I donâ€™t think so!

        The triangular shaped flaky pastry filled with spicy potato, chicken or lamb filling is a popular snack not only
        in India but in several countries of the world.

        Because samosa is so so common in India (you literally get samosa and chai at every other street corner), I
        always considered it to be a quintessential Indian delicacy.

        But only later I read that it has its origin in Middle East and it was introduced to India during the Delhi
        Sultanate rule.

        It was later adapted as a vegetarian snack with spicy potato filling in India (which is what is most popular in
        northern India).</p>
    <p>Anyway whatever the origin was, I can confidently say that samosa, especially Aloo Samosa is the most popular
        snack back home.

        Itâ€™s there in every party, office meeting, chai meet-ups, you name it and samosa will be there!

        I was very particular about the type of samosa that I liked and I liked it only from one shop in my hometown.

        Even now when I go home, I make sure to indulge in those samosas from my favorite shop.

        For me a good samosa should be crispy and most importantly it should not be oily at all.

        Here in the US I havenâ€™t had much luck finding good samosas so now I make them at home.

        And dare I say, they turn out as good as the one from my favorite shop in India! ðŸ™‚

        Making samosa is a multi-step process so I am not going to say itâ€™s super quick and easy.

        But the joy of biting into that homemade flaky crispy crust filled with spicy potatoes makes it all worth it.

        This is one of those treats that you should make for special occasions or over a weekend when you want to have
        some fun in the kitchen.</p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p> Start by making the samosa dough. To a large bowl, add flour, ajwain, salt and mix well.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Add the oil and then start mixing with your fingers.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Rub the flour with the oil until the oil is well incorporated in all of the flour. Do this for 3 to 4
                minutes, you donâ€™t want to rush this step.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Once incorporated, the mixture resembles crumbs.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Press some flour between your palm- it should form a shape (& not crumble) â€“ means oil is enough and well
                incorporated.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Now, start adding water, little by little and mix to form a stiff dough.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Donâ€™t overwork the dough and donâ€™t knead a soft dough. It should just come together and form a stiff
                dough. I used around 6 tablespoons of water here.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Cover the dough with a moist cloth and let it rest for 40 minutes. I usually soak a paper towel in water
                and then squeeze out all the water and then cover my dough with that.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>While the dough is resting, start working on the filling.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Boil potatoes until done</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>8 to 9 whistles on high heat with natural pressure release if using stove-top pressure cooker or if using
                Instant Pot, high pressure 12 minutes with natural pressure release on a trivet with 1 cup water in the
                bottom of the pot.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Peel the skin and them mash the potatoes. Set aside</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds, fennel
                seeds and crushed coriander seeds</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Let the seeds sizzle for few seconds and then add the chopped ginger, green chili and hing. Cook for 1
                minute.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add the boiled & mashed potatoes and green peas to the pan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Mix everything together. I use my potato masher to combine the spices and seasonings well with the
                potatoes and peas.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add the coriander powder, garam masala, amchur, red chili powder and salt</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Mix to combine. Once itâ€™s all well incorporated, remove pan from heat and let the filling cool down a
                bit.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Once the dough has rested, give it a quick knead. Then divide the dough into 7 equal parts of around
                58-60 grams each.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Start working on a piece of dough, keep the remaining dough balls covered at all times with a moist cloth
                else the dough will dry out.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Roll one dough ball into a circle-oval kind of shape, around 6-7 inches in diameter and then cut it into
                two parts.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Take one part and apply water on the straight edge/side. I usually mix some flour with water so that it
                forms a nice glue.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Now bring the two ends of the straight edge together and pinch them to form a cone. See picture (#20) for
                a better idea.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pinch the pointed ends to make it a perfect cone shape.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Fill the samosa with the potato filling, around 1 to 2 tablespoons. Donâ€™t overfill the samosa.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Now again apply water all around the circumference of the cone as you have to seal it. Pinch the opposite
                side (side opposite to where you pinched to form the cone) to form a plate (see picture #23).

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Now pinch the edges and seal the samosa.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Your samosa is now ready. Repeat with remaining dough. Always remember to keep the filled samosa covered
                with moist cloth while roll and fill the others.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Now heat oil in a kadai on low heat. To check if oil is ready, drop a small piece of dough into the oil.
                It should take few seconds to come up to the surface. That means the oil is ready.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Drop the shaped samosas into the oil.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Fry on low heat. After around 10-12 minutes, the samosa will become firm and light brown in color.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>At this point, increase the heat to medium and fry until it gets nicely browned.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Donâ€™t overcrowd the kadai/wok, fry 4-5 samosas at a time. And each batch will take around 20 minutes
                since we fry on low heat so be patient.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once you finish frying one batch, lower the heat again to low and wait until the temperature of the oil drops and
        then add the second batch.

        If you fry samosa on high heat, they will not get crispy and the dough will remain uncooked. The samosa will
        also have bubbles on the crust if you oil temperature is hot while frying the samosa.

        Enjoy hot samosas with cilantro chutney or sweet tamarind chutney! Yum!</p>
