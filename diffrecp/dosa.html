<p>well, there is a great story about the origin of the famous masale dosa. there are many stories around india, but according to the wiki, it originated from my hometown udupi. it was here in udupi, the dosa’s were made crisp and served. one of the local restaurants in udupi started to serve potato masala stuffed dosa as a variation and also to lower the coconut chutney consumption. in those days, coconut-based dishes were considered pricey and dosa’s cannot be consumed without any side dish. gradually stuffed dosa became one of the norms and the migrant community took this variety to mumbai and exposed it to a broader audience. it was very well received in the cosmopolitan city and that’s how it became one of the popular dose varieties.</p>
