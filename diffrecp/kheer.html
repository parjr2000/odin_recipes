    <p>Rice Kheer Recipe is an age-old traditional Indian pudding prepared with three basic ingredients – milk, rice,
        and sugar. It is a gluten-free kheer with a creamy, melt-in-mouth texture. I am sharing with a tried and tested
        rice kheer recipe of my family.</p>
    <h3>Kheer the Indian pudding</h3>
    <p>Kheer is a creamy, luscious, purely vegetarian Indian milk pudding. One of the most common types of kheer made on
        every auspicious occasion is the rice kheer. Also, known as chawal ki kheer. ‘Chawal’ is the Hindi term for
        rice.</p>
    <p>In India, we love our desserts, puddings dressed up in vivacious colors, luring perfumes embellished with edible
        adornment. But opposite to this, rice kheer has an elegant appearance. The fine layer of flavors, the adequate
        hint of saffron and cardamom perfume, and an uncomplicated air around rice kheer are few good enough reasons to
        make this pudding an Indian festive favorite dessert.

    </p>
    <p>In my house, most of the gleeful festive mornings are unfolded with a large pot of rice kheer brimming over the
        stovetop.

    </p>
    <p>The natural starch of the rice and the right condensation of the milk give chawal ki kheer its creamy texture.
        The addition of slightly crushed green cardamoms instills a subtle aroma in the pudding.

    <h2>step by step cooking</h2>
    <p>Rinse the rice till the water runs clear. Soak for 20 minutes.

    </p>
    <p>After 20 minutes, drain all the water from the soaked rice. Heat ghee in a pan. Add rice, fry for 3 – 5 minutes
        to soften the rice.

    </p>
    <p>Add milk, cardamom powder, stir and reduce the heat to the lowest setting. Now, slow cook the kheer till rice is
        soft, mushy, and the milk is thick.

    </p>
    <p>Once the texture of the kheer turns creamy, add sugar. Stir and simmer the kheer till sugar is completely
        dissolved.

    </p>
    <p>Heat ghee in a small pan. Add sliced nuts and dried fruits. Fry for 1 – 2 minutes without burning.

    </p>
    <p>Pour these ghee-fried nuts over the rice kheer before serving. They give a delicious crunch to the kheer.
